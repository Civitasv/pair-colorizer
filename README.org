* pair-colorizer

It is a fork from the brilliant [[https://github.com/Fanael/rainbow-delimiters][rainbow-delimiters]], base it, I develop the feature of emphasising delimiters of current cursor mode. Since I change too much of it, So I make a new repo to develop it.

** show case

#+CAPTION: example
#+Name: case
[[./case.gif]]

* Installation

You can install it manually, steps:
- download pair-colorizer.el
- put it into your load directory, ie: =(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/xx/xx")=
- =(require 'pair-colorizer)=
  
You can also use =package-install-from-buffer= to install it.

* Usage

To toggle the =pair-colorizer-mode= in the current buffer:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  M-x pair-colorizer-mode
#+end_src

At default, the =pair-colorizer-emphasise= is enable, if you don't like it, you can turn off it use:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables '(pair-colorizer-emphasise nil))
#+end_src

To start the mode automatically in most programming modes (Emacs 24 and above):

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook #'pair-colorizer-mode)
#+end_src

* configuration

You can set your own rainbow colors use:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq pair-colorizer-light-colors ["#xx" "#xx"])
  (setq pair-colorizer-dark-colors ["#xx" "#xx"])
#+end_src

You can also use customize-group to customize various options, including the color theme:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  M-x customize-group <RET> pair-colorizer
#+end_src

The config above cannot change the detail face when emphasise, you can specify faces by customizing following faces:

- Colorized faces take the form =pair-colorizer-depth-N-face=, with N being the length of your colors vector, at default N equals 9.
- Emphasised faces take the form =pair-colorizer-emphasise-depth-N-face=, with N being the length of your colors vector, at default N equals 9.
- You can toggle emphasise feature using =pair-colorizer-emphasise=.
- The unmatched delimiter face: =pair-colorizer-unmatched-face=.
- The mismatched delimiter face: =pair-colorizer-mismatched-face=.

Below is my configuration for the theme =doom-material=.

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (custom-set-variables '(pair-colorizer-emphasise t))
  (setq pair-colorizer-dark-colors
        ["#c792ea" "#f78c6c" "#c3e88d" "#89DDFF" "#bb80b3"
         "#ffcb6b" "#82aaff" "#44b9b1" "#80cbc4"])
  (custom-set-faces
   '(pair-colorizer-base-face ((t (:inherit default))))
   '(pair-colorizer-base-error-face ((t (:inherit pair-colorizer-base-face :foreground "#ff5370"))))
   '(pair-colorizer-unmatched-face ((t (:foreground "#ff5370" :inverse-video t :weight bold))))
   '(pair-colorizer-mismatched-face ((t (:inherit pair-colorizer-unmatched-face))))
#+end_src

Hope it will help you!

And I'll appreciate it if you can star this repo.
